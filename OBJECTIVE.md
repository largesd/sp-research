### Sub-Agents Configuration

- **Default count per researcher**: 5
- **Research rounds**: 2
- **Max sub-agents per round**: 5 (can use up to the default count)

## Research Process

### Round 1: Foundation Research
Each researcher deploys sub-agents to gather foundational information:
- Historical precedents of technological unemployment
- Current AI impact on various industries
- Existing policy frameworks and social safety nets
- Expert opinions and academic research

### Round 2: Deep Dive & Synthesis
Sub-agents can reference Round 1 materials to:
- Analyze specific solutions proposed in previous research
- Evaluate feasibility of different approaches
- Identify gaps and potential synergies between solutions
- Propose actionable recommendations

## Output Requirements

1. **Research Materials**: Stored in each researcher's `memory/` folder
   - Human-readable markdown format
   - Clear organization by topic/area
   - Proper citations with sources, origin, and references

2. **Summary**: Each researcher produces a `SUMMARY.md` synthesizing all research rounds
   - Executive summary
   - Key findings from each round
   - Recommendations
   - References

## Research Areas for Sub-Agents

Each researcher should assign their 5 sub-agents to cover:
1. Economic impact analysis
2. Policy and governance solutions
3. Education and reskilling strategies
4. Social safety net alternatives (UBI, etc.)
5. Technological adaptation and new job creation
