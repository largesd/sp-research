# Research Objective: Mass Unemployment in the Post-AI Era

## Research Topic
How to solve the potential problem of mass unemployment in the post-AI era?

## Location Focus

**Target Location:** Hong Kong

This research will focus on policy solutions tailored for Hong Kong's unique context:
- High cost of living and housing
- Service-oriented economy with strong finance sector
- Aging population
- Limited social safety net traditions
- Close integration with mainland China's economy
- Strong emphasis on education and professional qualifications

## Configuration

### Researchers (3)

### Policy Agent

| Parameter          | Value                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|

| LLM Model          | qwen/qwen3-max                                  |
| Language           | English                                         |
| Max Proposal Words | 3000                                            |
| Target Location    | Hong Kong                                       |
| Proposal Terms     | Short-term (1-2 years), Mid-term (3-5 years), Long-term (5+ years) |

The Policy agent will:
1. Study all research materials from Paul, Mary, and Ming
2. Synthesize findings into actionable policy proposals
3. Develop short, mid, and long-term deployment strategies specific to Hong Kong
4. Remain objective without personal preference
5. Base all recommendations solely on the research materials

### Sub-Agents Configuration

- **Default count per researcher**: 5
- **Research rounds**: 2
- **Max sub-agents per round**: 5 (can use up to the default count)

## Research Process

### Round 1: Foundation Research
Each researcher deploys sub-agents to gather foundational information:
- Historical precedents of technological unemployment
- Current AI impact on various industries
- Existing policy frameworks and social safety nets
- Expert opinions and academic research

### Round 2: Deep Dive & Synthesis
Sub-agents can reference Round 1 materials to:
- Analyze specific solutions proposed in previous research
- Evaluate feasibility of different approaches
- Identify gaps and potential synergies between solutions
- Propose actionable recommendations

### Phase 3: Policy Proposal
The Policy agent reviews all research summaries and materials to:
- Identify common themes and divergent viewpoints
- Evaluate policy options for Hong Kong's specific context
- Develop integrated short, mid, and long-term policy proposals
- Create actionable implementation roadmap

## Output Requirements

1. **Research Materials**: Stored in each researcher's `memory/` folder
   - Human-readable markdown format
   - Clear organization by topic/area
   - Proper citations with sources, origin, and references

2. **Summary**: Each researcher produces a `SUMMARY.md` synthesizing all research rounds
   - Executive summary
   - Key findings from each round
   - Recommendations
   - References

3. **Policy Proposal**: The Policy agent produces `PROPOSAL.md`
   - Executive summary
   - Analysis of research findings
   - Short-term policies (1-2 years)
   - Mid-term policies (3-5 years)
   - Long-term policies (5+ years)
   - Implementation considerations
   - References

## Research Areas for Sub-Agents

Each researcher should assign their 5 sub-agents to cover:
1. Economic impact analysis
2. Policy and governance solutions
3. Education and reskilling strategies
4. Social safety net alternatives (UBI, etc.)
5. Technological adaptation and new job creation
