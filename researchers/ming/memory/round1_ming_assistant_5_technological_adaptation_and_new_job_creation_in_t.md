## Key Facts and Data Points

- **Historical Precedent**: During the Industrial Revolution, fears of mass unemployment due to mechanization were widespread, yet employment levels eventually stabilized as new job categories emerged (Autor, 2015).

- **AI Impact Projections**: According to a 2023 report by the World Economic Forum (WEF), AI and automation could displace **85 million jobs globally by 2025**, but may also create **97 million new roles** that are more adapted to the new division of labor between humans, machines, and algorithms.

- **Sectoral Shifts**: The OECD (2023) estimates that **27% of jobs** in OECD countries are at high risk of automation, particularly in routine-based clerical, administrative, and manufacturing roles. However, demand is rising in AI-augmented fields like data analysis, cybersecurity, and green energy.

- **Labor Market Polarization**: Empirical studies (e.g., Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019) show that automation has contributed to **job polarization**—growth in high-skill and low-skill jobs, with a decline in middle-skill occupations—exacerbating wage inequality.

- **Reskilling Gaps**: A McKinsey Global Institute (2021) study found that **up to 100 million workers globally may need to switch occupations by 2030**, and current reskilling systems are insufficient to meet this demand.

## Relevant Theories and Frameworks

1. **Task-Based Model of Automation (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2018)**: This framework posits that automation affects jobs based on the tasks they involve. AI substitutes routine tasks but can complement non-routine cognitive or interpersonal tasks, leading to job transformation rather than outright elimination.

2. **Skill-Biased Technological Change (SBTC)**: Suggests that technological progress increases demand for skilled labor while reducing demand for unskilled labor, contributing to wage inequality (Katz & Murphy, 1992).

3. **Job Creation through Innovation (Schumpeterian Creative Destruction)**: Emphasizes that while AI may destroy certain jobs, it simultaneously fosters innovation that spawns entirely new industries and occupations (e.g., app developers after smartphone proliferation).

4. **Human–AI Collaboration Framework**: Recent research (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014; Daugherty & Wilson, 2018) argues that the greatest productivity gains occur when humans and AI systems collaborate, with humans focusing on empathy, creativity, and complex judgment.

## Current State of Knowledge

The consensus among economists and labor scholars is that **AI will not cause mass unemployment per se**, but will significantly reshape the labor market. The primary challenge lies in **transition costs**: workers displaced from automatable roles may lack the skills, geographic mobility, or support systems to transition into emerging roles.

Key unresolved issues include:
- The **speed of AI adoption** may outpace institutional adaptation (e.g., education systems, labor policies).
- **Geographic and demographic disparities**: Low-income regions and older workers face higher barriers to reskilling.
- **Quality of new jobs**: Not all new roles offer comparable wages, stability, or benefits to displaced positions.

Policy responses under active discussion include:
- **Lifelong learning accounts** and portable benefits
- **AI-driven career navigation tools**
- **Public–private reskilling partnerships**
- **Job guarantees or wage subsidies** for transitioning workers

### Key Insights

- AI is projected to displace 85 million jobs by 2025 but create 97 million new ones, suggesting net job growth if transitions are managed well.
- The primary risk is not job loss in aggregate, but mismatch between displaced workers’ skills and emerging job requirements.
- The task-based model shows AI substitutes routine tasks but complements human strengths in creativity, empathy, and judgment.
- Historical technological shifts show job markets eventually adapt, but policy intervention is crucial to reduce transition costs and inequality.
- Reskilling at scale is the central challenge; current systems are inadequate for the pace of AI-driven labor market transformation.
