## Key Facts and Data Points

- **Automation Risk**: A 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report estimated that up to **800 million global workers** could be displaced by automation by 2030, with **30% of tasks in 60% of occupations** automatable using current technologies [1].
- **AI Acceleration**: Recent advances in generative AI (e.g., large language models) have expanded automation beyond routine manual tasks to include cognitive and creative roles, increasing displacement risk for white-collar workers [2].
- **Labor Market Polarization**: OECD data shows a trend of **job polarization**, with growth in high-skill and low-skill jobs but decline in middle-skill roles—exacerbated by AI adoption [3].
- **Geographic Disparities**: The impact of AI-driven unemployment is uneven; developing economies with large informal sectors may face different challenges than advanced economies with robust social safety nets [4].

## Relevant Theories and Frameworks

1. **Technological Unemployment Theory**: Originating with Keynes (1930), this theory posits that rapid technological change can outpace labor market adaptation, leading to sustained joblessness [5].

2. **Skill-Biased Technological Change (SBTC)**: Suggests that technology favors high-skilled workers, widening inequality and displacing mid- and low-skilled labor [6].

3. **Just Transition Framework**: Originally from environmental policy, this governance approach emphasizes **equitable, inclusive planning** for workforce transitions, ensuring affected workers are not left behind [7].

4. **Social Contract Theory in the Digital Age**: Calls for redefining the relationship between state, market, and citizen—e.g., through universal basic income (UBI) or job guarantees—as traditional employment-based welfare systems become obsolete [8].

## Current State of Knowledge

Policy scholars increasingly agree that **proactive governance**—not reactive measures—is essential to mitigate AI-induced unemployment. Key policy domains include:

- **Labor Market Policies**: Reskilling/upskilling programs, lifelong learning accounts, and portable benefits tied to individuals rather than employers.
- **Social Protection**: Proposals for **UBI**, **negative income tax**, or **conditional cash transfers** to decouple income from employment.
- **Tax and Fiscal Policy**: "Robot taxes" (proposed by Bill Gates) or AI levies to fund transition programs, though controversial due to innovation disincentives [9].
- **Public Employment Programs**: Government as employer of last resort (e.g., job guarantees in green or care economies) [10].
- **Regulatory Governance**: Mandating **algorithmic transparency**, **impact assessments**, and worker representation in AI deployment decisions (e.g., EU AI Act proposals) [11].

Empirical evidence remains limited due to the nascent stage of AI’s labor impact, but pilot programs (e.g., Finland’s UBI experiment, Singapore’s SkillsFuture) offer early insights.

### Key Insights

- AI-driven automation threatens not only manual but also cognitive and creative jobs, expanding the scope of potential unemployment beyond historical patterns.
- Policy responses must be multi-dimensional—combining labor market interventions, social protection reform, fiscal innovation, and regulatory governance.
- The 'Just Transition' framework offers a normative and practical guide for equitable policy design, emphasizing inclusion and worker agency.
- There is growing consensus that decoupling income from traditional employment (e.g., via UBI or job guarantees) may be necessary in a post-AI labor landscape.
- Global disparities mean policy solutions must be context-sensitive—what works in high-income welfare states may not apply in low-income informal economies.
