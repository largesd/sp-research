## Overview

As artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies advance rapidly, concerns about large-scale displacement of human labor have intensified. Economists, policymakers, and technologists increasingly warn of a potential "post-AI era" characterized by structural or even mass unemployment, particularly in routine, cognitive, and service-sector jobs. In this context, traditional social safety nets—often tied to employment—may become inadequate, prompting renewed interest in alternative models such as Universal Basic Income (UBI), Job Guarantees, and Conditional Cash Transfers.

## Key Facts and Data Points

- **Automation Risk**: A 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report estimated that as much as **30% of the tasks in around 60% of occupations** could be automated with current technologies, potentially displacing up to **800 million global workers by 2030** (Manyika et al., 2017).

- **AI-Specific Displacement**: Unlike earlier automation waves that primarily affected manual labor, AI threatens cognitive and creative roles. A 2023 study by OpenAI suggests that **~80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their tasks affected by large language models (LLMs)**, with **19% of workers seeing more than 50% of their tasks impacted** (Eloundou et al., 2023).

- **UBI Pilot Results**: Finland’s 2017–2018 UBI experiment provided €560/month to 2,000 unemployed individuals. Findings showed **no significant increase in employment**, but participants reported **improved well-being, reduced stress, and greater trust in social institutions** (Kangas et al., 2020).

- **Public Support**: A 2020 Pew Research Center survey found that **55% of Americans supported some form of UBI**, though support varied significantly by political affiliation and income level.

## Relevant Theories and Frameworks

### 1. **Technological Unemployment Hypothesis**
Originating with Keynes (1930), this theory posits that rapid technological change can outpace labor market adjustment, leading to persistent joblessness. In the AI context, Brynjolfsson & McAfee (2014) argue that we are in a period of "**the great decoupling**"—where productivity rises while wages and employment stagnate.

### 2. **Post-Work Theory**
Philosophers like André Gorz and Aaron Bastani envision a future where automation liberates humans from wage labor, enabling a flourishing "post-work" society. UBI is seen as a prerequisite for this transition, providing economic security without tying income to employment.

### 3. **Social Contract Reimagining**
Traditional welfare systems assume a reciprocal relationship: citizens work, pay taxes, and receive benefits when needed. AI-driven unemployment challenges this model, prompting calls for a **new social contract** based on citizenship or human dignity rather than labor contribution (Van Parijs & Vanderborght, 2017).

## Current State of Knowledge

### Universal Basic Income (UBI)
- **Definition**: Regular, unconditional cash payments to all citizens.
- **Pros**: Simplicity, reduces bureaucracy, empowers individual choice, provides a floor against poverty.
- **Cons**: High fiscal cost (estimated at 10–15% of GDP in developed nations), potential inflationary pressures, political feasibility.
- **Evidence**: Small-scale pilots (e.g., Finland, Kenya, Stockton, CA) show psychological and health benefits but limited employment effects.

### Job Guarantee (JG)
- **Definition**: Government as employer of last resort, offering public-service jobs at a living wage.
- **Pros**: Maintains work ethic, provides structure, addresses unmet community needs.
- **Cons**: May crowd out private-sector jobs, administrative complexity, questions about job quality.
- **Evidence**: Limited large-scale implementation; historical analogs include the U.S. New Deal programs.

### Negative Income Tax (NIT)
- **Definition**: A refundable tax credit that phases out with income.
- **Pros**: Targeted, less costly than UBI, preserves work incentives.
- **Cons**: Stigmatization, bureaucratic eligibility checks.
- **Evidence**: 1970s U.S. experiments showed modest work disincentives but significant poverty reduction.

### Other Models
- **Universal Basic Services (UBS)**: Provides free access to essential services (healthcare, education, transport) instead of cash. Proposed by the U.K.-based Institute for Global Prosperity.
- **Data Dividend**: Citizens receive payments from the monetization of their personal data—an idea championed by Andrew Yang during his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign.

### Key Insights

- AI-driven automation threatens not just manual but cognitive and creative jobs, potentially displacing hundreds of millions globally by 2030.
- UBI pilots show consistent improvements in well-being and mental health, even without significant employment effects.
- Alternative models like Job Guarantees and Universal Basic Services offer complementary or competing visions to UBI, each with distinct trade-offs in cost, feasibility, and philosophical grounding.
- The core challenge is redefining the social contract in an era where human labor may no longer be the primary source of economic value.
- Current evidence supports UBI as a viable buffer against AI-induced precarity, but large-scale fiscal and political hurdles remain.
