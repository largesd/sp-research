    "content": "## Executive Summary\n\nThe transition to a post-AI economy presents unprecedented governance challenges, with estimates suggesting 300–400 million jobs globally could face displacement by 2030. This research synthesizes current policy frameworks addressing technological unemployment through income security mechanisms, labor market adaptation strategies, and institutional governance reforms. Key findings indicate that no single intervention (such as Universal Basic Income alone) can solve mass displacement; rather, a 'portfolio approach' combining reskilling, working-time reduction, fiscal redistribution, and social protection is required.\n\n## Key Facts and Data Points\n\n- **Displacement Projections**: Goldman Sachs (2023) estimates generative AI could expose 300 million full-time jobs to automation, while McKinsey Global Institute projects 400–800 million individuals displaced by 2030, requiring 75 million to switch occupational categories entirely.\n- **Task Polarization**: Research by Acemoglu and Autor (2019) indicates AI disproportionately affects 'routine cognitive' and 'routine manual' tasks, while non-routine interpersonal and creative tasks show resilience, suggesting governance must focus on task reallocation rather than occupation elimination.\n- **Skills Gap**: The World Economic Forum (2023) forecasts that 44% of workers' core skills will be disrupted by 2027, with 60% of workers requiring reskilling by 2025.\n- **Geographic Variance**: Developing economies face higher vulnerability due to higher shares of routine manual labor and weaker social protection infrastructure (ILO, 2019). The informal economy—comprising 2 billion workers globally—lacks safety nets during AI transition.\n- **Productivity Gains**: IMF (2024) estimates AI will affect 40% of global employment, with advanced economies facing 60% exposure; however, productivity gains may reach 1.5% annual GDP growth in high-adoption scenarios.\n\n## Theoretical Frameworks\n\n### 1. Task-Based Approach (Acemoglu & Autor)\nMoving beyond Skill-Biased Technological Change (SBTC), the task-based framework analyzes how automation displaces specific tasks rather than entire occupations. This implies governance should incentivize 'human-machine complementarity'—augmentation rather than replacement—and focus on task reallocation policies.\n\n### 2. Just Transition Framework\nOriginating from climate policy (ILO Guidelines 2015), this framework emphasizes social dialogue, anticipating change, and adequate social protection during economic transitions. The OECD (2023) has formally recommended applying Just Transition principles to AI governance, including advance notice of automation, portable benefits, and community-based adjustment programs.\n\n### 3. Flexicurity\nThe Danish model combines flexible hiring/firing rules with generous unemployment benefits and Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs). Denmark
